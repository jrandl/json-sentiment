{"lyrics": "Don't you notice how\r\nI get quiet when there's no one else around?\r\nMe and you and awkward silence\r\nDon't you dare look at me that way\r\nI don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same\n\nOh, the burning pain\n\nListening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate\n\n\"She's so perfect,\" blah, blah, blah\n\nOh, how I wish you'd wake up one day\n\nRun to me, confess your love, at least just let me say\n\n\n\nThat when I talk to you\n\nOh, Cupid walks right through\n\nAnd shoots an arrow through my heart\n\nAnd I sound like a loon\n\nBut don't you feel it, too?\n\nConfess I loved you from the start\n\n\n\nWhat's a girl to do?\n\nLying on my bed staring into the blue\n\nUnrequited, terrifying\n\nLove is driving me a bit insane\n\nHave to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today\n\n\n\nThat when I talk to you\n\nOh, Cupid walks right through\n\nAnd shoots an arrow through my heart\n\nAnd I sound like a loon\n\nBut don't you feel it, too?\n\nConfess I loved you from the start\n\n\n\nConfess I loved you\n\nJust thinking of you\n\nYou know I've loved you from the start"}
