{"lyrics": "It's been a while\r\nI've been out on my own\r\nI get a little anxious when you call me on the phone\r\nSomebody said that it\r\nIt fades away\r\nBut in the interim it was hard to see that way\n\n\n\nIt's been a while\n\nI've been out on my own\n\nI'm in denial about living life alone\n\n\n\nI said I don't like change but I'm not afraid\n\nI can't keep it together ever anyway\n\nWhen every page is in disarray\n\nI think we'll be okay\n\nI said I don't like change but I'm not afraid\n\nI can't keep it together ever anyway\n\nWhen every page is in disarray\n\nI think we'll be okay that way\n\n\n\nI thought it'd change when i got older\n\nBut the same year came over and over\n\nAnd the only change that I could feel\n\nWas the aging of my bones\n\nAnd then in one October\n\nWhen the sidewalk home was covered over\n\nWell I don't know the method\n\nBut you pulled life from the loam\n\n\n\nIt's been a while\n\nI've been out on my own\n\nAnd I'm in denial about living life alone\n\n\n\nI said I don't like change but I'm not afraid\n\nI can't keep it together ever anyway\n\nWhen every page is in disarray\n\nI think we'll be okay\n\nI said I don't like change but I'm not afraid\n\nI can't keep it together ever anyway\n\nWhen every page is in disarray\n\nI think we'll be okay that way"}
